          <h1>Fashion and Cosmetics</h1>
          <h2>Starting my own business in the fashion and cosmetics industry is one of my biggest passions.</h2>

      <p>I am very passionate about starting a business in the fashion and cosmetics industry. I feel like as a child, I was naturally drawn to fashion and the beauty of art/makeup.
I was introduced to fashion and cosmetics at a very young age by the females in my family and by watching celebrities. As a child when asked what did I want to be when I got older, I often replied with “fashion designer”.</p>

      <p>In the beginning, watching older females in my family such as my mom and aunt led in sparking my passion for cosmetics and clothing. 
I would say that my biggest inspiration till this day would be myself. As I continue to learn more about myself, my opinion gradually changes and my aspect on fashion/cosmetics changes each day as I continue to learn more about the industry, giving me more inspiration day by day.</p>
